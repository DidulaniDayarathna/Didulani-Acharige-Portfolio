## Projects
#### Designing and developing prototype of a mini drill press machine
  - Designed and developed a prototype of a mini drill press machine by using AutoCAD and Solid work software. It was constructed to use as a PCB circuit board drill machine by acquiring workshop experience. Under this project, lathe machines, milling machines, drilling machine, saw machines, & other mechanical workshop tools were utilized for the implementation.
#### AVR Programming for Embedded Systems: LED Cube Design
  - Designed and programmed an LED cube using AVR microcontrollers for embedded systems. The project involved developing custom electronics and implementing efficient control algorithms to create dynamic visual patterns. Demonstrated expertise in embedded programming, hardware design, and system integration.
#### Bird Contamination Removal in Wind Profile Radar Data
  - Developed and implemented a machine learning algorithm utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to remove bird contamination from wind profile radar data. The project leveraged data collected from the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Payerne, Switzerland, demonstrating expertise in data preprocessing, model training, and real-world application of machine learning techniques to improve radar data quality.
#### Machine Learning in interpolation and extrapolation for nanophotonic inverse design
   - Developed machine learning-based approaches to optimize the algorithmic design of nanophotonic structures, improving the efficiency and performance of these components. Explored the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and hybrid techniques to predict and design optical responses with reduced computational costs. Demonstrated that pretrained neural networks perform well in predicting optical responses for both interpolation and extrapolation tasks with minimal additional training. Additionally, traditional deep neural networks were shown to excel in extrapolation tasks compared to more complex architectures, enabling the generation of nanophotonic structures with spectral responses beyond the training dataset. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the inverse design of nanophotonic systems.
#### Hybrid deep learning for design of nanophotonic quantum emitter lenses
   - Investigated a hybrid deep learning approach for the inverse design of 3D nanophotonic lenses, combining the performance of adjoint-based topology optimization with a convolutional generative network. This approach improves performance over adjoint optimization alone by handling additional design constraints, enabling faster iterative training with large datasets, and utilizing transfer learning for efficient retraining with minimal new samples. The method is applicable to general nanophotonic design, especially when multiple design parameters and constraints are involved.
#### Generative Tandem Neural Network (GTNN) for the inverse design of color splitter structures
   - We propose a novel single input, multiple output tandem neural network for the inverse design of color splitter nanophotonic structures, addressing the limitations of traditional single input, single output networks. These color splitters aim to replace color filters in digital cameras, reducing absorptive losses. The network is trained using a small, high-quality dataset and iterative transfer learning. Combined with genetic algorithm optimization, this approach outperforms traditional topology optimization, offering a more effective and resource-efficient method for nanophotonic design.
#### Deep learning for the inverse design of high dimensional color splitter structures
   - We expanded our work to utilize deep learning for the inverse design of high-dimensional color splitter nanophotonic structures, addressing the limitations of traditional single input, single output networks. These advanced color splitters are designed to replace color filters in digital cameras, mitigating absorptive losses. Leveraging iterative transfer learning and training on a small, high-quality dataset, we optimized these structures and validated their design through fabrication using two-photon lithography. This approach offers a more efficient and practical method for designing and producing high-performance nanophotonic devices.
